# Memberlist Cleaner

Planned features:
- Mass kick members from a Discord server based on:
  - Last message sent

Due to Discord's rate limits, this bot can only kick 1 user per second, which could lead to several hours of runtime for large servers. Use with caution.

Most of the code is in [prune.js](https://github.com/LemonPocky/memberlist-cleaner/blob/main/src/commands/moderation/prune.js).
